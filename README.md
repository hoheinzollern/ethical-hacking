## Project:
1. Find a project/organization, identify/agree on responsible disclosure policy.
2. Preliminary exploration: HW/SW architecture, security model and assumptions.
3. Choose a technique from class and hack away :)
4. Follow through with responsible disclosure.

## TODO: 
1. consider incident/response
2. invite cave to give a talk for HW hacking

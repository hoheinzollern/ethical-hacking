#+title: Ethical Hacking course
#+author: Alessandro Bruni
#+date: 30-1-2024
* Abstract

This is an applied course on information security. The course focuses
on in-depth penetration testing techniques, elements of cryptanalysis
and digital forensics, ethical aspects of security and responsible
disclosure.

* Description

In this course you will gain the skills necessary to become a security
analyst/penetration tester. You will have already taken an
introductory course on information security, and this course will give
you an opportunity to learn more advanced tools for software analysis
and exploitation, learn about the ethics of hacking and the
responsible disclosure process.

* Topics

The course will cover the following topics:
- Ethics of hacking and responsible disclosure
- Advanced exploitation tools (reconnaissance and payload generation)
- Elements of cryptanalysis 
- Digital forensics

* Formal Prerequisites

Before the course you must:
- Be familiar with security principles and risk analysis,
- Be familiar with network security, web and binary penetration
  testing
- Know basics of security protocols and cryptography 
- Know basic algorithms and data structures
- Be familiar with operating systems and architectures, databases and
  compilers 
- Have implemented at least two medium-size programming projects

* Intended Learning Outcomes

After the course, you should be able to:

- Apply the principle of responsible disclosure
- Discuss ethical issues in computer security
- Use cryptanalysis to break vulnerable encryption schemes
- Apply semi-automated exploitation tools for web/database/binary
  vulnerabilities
- Conduct digital forensics analysis

* Learning Activities

This course follows the project-based learning approach.

Teaching consists of: Lectures, Exercise sessions, Experimental lab
work, Project work

The first part of the course consists of lectures and exercises that
cover the main theoretical aspects of the ILOs. There are *two
mandatory activities* in the course, in which you are asked to conduct
cryptanalysis for a known vulnerable cipher, and to work with a
framework for doing automated exploitation (e.g. metasploit, SQLmap,
pwntools).

The second part of the course consists of a project, in which you
choose a target to analyse using the techniques and methodologies
learned throughout the course. In the final deliverable you must
present your discoveries in at least one of the technical aspects
discussed in class (cryptanalysis, binary exploitation, forensics) and
demonstrate that you conducted your project according to the
principles of responsible disclosure, discussing the ethics of your
project work.

* Mandatory Activities

Two mandatory hand-ins (cryptanalysis+exploitation assignments), one
project.

* Project ideas

Think about your hacking project, you can come up with your own idea,
but here are some points of inspiration (and contact persons that
could help you): 
- Software as a Medical Device (SaMD): Dexcom insuline pumps,
  Freestyle LibreLink, Supersapiens glucose monitors, SkinVision app
  for detecting dangerous moles, Generic Infusion Pump (GIP,
  opensource) -- Marco Carbone
- Hack a security camera -- Marco Carbone
- Hack a CAN bus device -- Rosario Giustolisi
- Hack the Swiss Post e-voting system (open source) -- Oksana Kulyk
- Hack a connected doorlock/voting machine/connected toys --
  Alessandro Bruni/Carsten Schürmann

* Exam form

- Group submission of your project
- Project report: present your hacking project, what you discovered,
  how you approached responsible disclosure if applicable, key
  takeaways
- 20 minute oral exam on the group submission

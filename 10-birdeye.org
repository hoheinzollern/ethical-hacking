:END:
- This has never happened before
  - Therefore it will not happen, ever
- Security products are secure
  - Naturally, they can't be hacked
- This is outside our threat model
  - So, hackers will stay away and won't hack
- Our employees are fully trusted
  - No disgruntled people, no insider jobs
- There is no public exploit for this bug
  - Of course, it cannot be used against my system
- This is a proprietary system/feature/technology
  - Therefore, it is automagically protected from hackers

** Examples
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: examples-1
:END:
- User supported input will always be well-formed
  - At worst, the program will produce garbage
- My program has the whole machine for itself
  - Resources I need will not be touched by anything else
- No external factors will influence program execution
  - Voltage, temperature, background radiation, illumination are not a
    factor
- Program execution will not leak any information
  - Everything takes zero power and no time
- System memory works perfectly well
  - Whatever other programs write will not influence what I read

* What about your product?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: what-about-your-product

- Have you ever assumed Evil Input won't reach your component?
- Have you ever assumed your product will only be installed in a
  protected location?
- Have you ever assumed nobody will ever take your product apart?
- Have you ever assumed whoever installs it will know how to configure
  it securely?
- Have you ever assumed ...

** What to do

:END:
*** Document
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: document
:END:
- Write your assumptions down
- Make the assumptions explicit
- Documented assumptions become requirements
- Requirements will be handled after the design phase

*** Validate
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: validate
:END:
- Review your list of assumptions
  - independently as well
- Does everything make sense?
- Is everything accounted for?
- If yes, then you are good to go and write some code

*** Identifying and exploiting bugs is nice
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
- Testing pens for fun and profit

- Consulting work aka telling people to do their work properly

- Bug finding for them bounties

- You get a CVE, you get a CVE, everyone gets a CVE!

- It feels great!

- ... but what about the impact of your work?

*** Identifying and breaking assumptions is amazing!
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: identifying-and-breaking-assumptions-is-amazing
:END:
- Apart from sub par work, most issues are caused by assumptions
- Exploited a nice bug? Owned one product
- Broke a nice assumption? Owned the whole planet
  - Morris worm
  - Kocher's power analysis work
  - Spectre
  - Rowhammer

* Think proactive, not reactive
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: think-proactive-not-reactive
:END:
- We already know assumptions cause big problems
  - Why challenge small problems when you can tackle big issues?
  - Why settle for small catch when you can go for big game?
  - Why identify bugs when you can identify assumptions?
- Identify assumptions proactively!
- Challenge ideas, not the paper they are printed on
- Challenge the way of working, not the final product
- Challenge assumptions, not implementations

* Hack the planet!

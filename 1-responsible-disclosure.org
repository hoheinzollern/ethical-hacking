* What is responsible disclosure?


According to Wikipedia:

#+begin_quote
In computer security, responsible disclosure (also known as coordinated
vulnerability disclosure) is a vulnerability disclosure model in which a
vulnerability or an issue is disclosed only after a period of time that
allows for the vulnerability or issue to be patched or mended.

#+end_quote

* Key elements


- *Disclosure*: the vulnerability is disclosed to the public
- *Embargo period*: the disclosure happens after a period of time that
  allows the vulnerability to be fixed
- *Coordinated*: the hacker and the relevant organization work together
  to fix the vulnerability

* Elements of Danish Cybersecurity Law


** i.e.: how to stay away from trouble?


(from https://www.cybertraining.dk/regulation_1/)

#+caption: image.png
[[file:img/criminal-mind.jpg]]

** "nulla poena sine lege poenali"


** -- "no punishment without the law"


** Recipe for a crime


1. *Actus reus*: the criminal act
2. *Mens rea*: the mental condition of guilt
3. *Impunity*: e.g. self-defence, consent

** Actus reus - the criminal act


- *Crime* is the act described by a statute
- *Attempted crime* "shall be punished as an attempt when the offence is
  not completed"
- *Withdrawal from attempt* when the perpetrator voluntarily prevents
  the crime's completion
- *Complicity* the punishment applies to accomplices as well
- *Withdrawal from complicity* when the accomplices stop the perpetrator
  from completing the crime

** Mens rea - the mental condition


*** Intention


- *direct intention*: committing an offence with purpose or knowledge
- *high probability*: no direct intention, but the perpetrator saw the
  effect of their conduct as a highly probable consequence of the act
- *eventuality*: the person sees the occurrence of the crime as a
  possible outcome but would have acted even if he had seen it as
  certain

*** Negligence


- the person has not acted with the appropriate care and consideration
  for others

** Special Circumstances of Impunity


*** Self-defence



#+begin_quote
Acts committed in self-defence are exempt from punishment if they were
necessary to resist or ward off a present or imminent wrongful assault
and do not manifestly exceed the limits of what is reasonable in view of
the danger from the assault, the assailant himself and the importance of
the interest assaulted.

#+end_quote

The Danish Criminal Code section 13(1)

*** Consent


- Consent from the victim can lead to impunity:

#+begin_quote
For instance, consent from the owner of an IT system to a person to hack
the system in order to search for security vulnerabilities will not be
punishable according to the statute of 'hacking' in the Danish Criminal
Code.

#+end_quote

* Danish regulation concerning cybercrime


No specific definition of cybercrime has been established, so what is
exactly cybercrime?

Two types of cybercrime: - where data systems are attacked, e.g. hacking
or DDoS - where other kinds of crimes are facilitated by digital means
or communication platforms, e.g. fraud or threats


** Key provisions

We focus on the *hacking provision* (§ 263) and *data fraud* (§ 279)

Additional provisions:
- Threats (§ 266) 
- Unjustified coercion (§ 260) 
- Blackmail (§ 281) 
- Child sexual abuse material (§ 235) 
- Acts of indecency (§ 232) 
- Defamation (§ 267-271)

...and others (see material)







** The Hacking Provision
#+b
A fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year and six months
is imposed on any person who gains unauthorized access to any data or
programs of another person intended for use in a data system.

[[https://danskelove.dk/straffeloven/263][Straffeloven § 263]]














** Fraud and Data Fraud

Fraud covers all tricks one person plays on another, to obtain an
unlawful gain

#+begin_quote
A person is guilty of fraud if, by wrongfully creating, confirming or
exploiting a mistake to obtain an unlawful gain for himself or others,
he induces another person to perform or fail to perform an act and
thereby inflicts a property loss on such other person or someone to whom
the performance or failure becomes essential.

[[https://danskelove.dk/straffeloven/279][Straffeloven § 279]]

Fraud is punishable with up to *8 years in prison*









** Data fraud

Traditionally fraud only covered actions where /humans/ were being
deceived. /Data fraud/ covers those circumstances where the /data
system/ is deceived.

#+begin_quote
A person is guilty of data fraud if he wrongfully edits, adds or deletes
data or programs for electronic data processing or otherwise wrongfully
attempts to influence the output of such data processing to obtain an
unlawful gain for himself or others.

[[https://danskelove.dk/straffeloven/279a][Straffeloven § 279 a]]

*** No damage required


Note that data fraud is completed when data are entered into the system
and there is no requirement that the victim incurs a loss.

* Esben & the Criminal Law


- *Actus reus*: Has Esben committed acts covered by the /hacking
  provision/ (§ 263) or /data fraud/ (§ 279)
- *Mens rea*: What is Esben's mental condition? Intention/high
  probability/eventuality/negligence
- *Impunity*: Has Esben acted in self-defence or under consent?

Work out the answers in groups.

* Bug Bounty Programmes

** HackerOne 2020 report



#+begin_quote
No industry or profession has experienced an evolution quite like
hacking. It started in the darkest underbelly of the internet, where
hackers roamed the online world in search of vulnerabilities.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
It later grew into a respectable hobby, something that talented people
could do on the side. Now it's a professional calling: hackers,
pentesters, and security researchers are trusted and respected, and they
provide a valuable service for us all.

TODO

* Bug bounty programmes today


- *Public bug-bounty program*: an open program any hacker can
  participate in for a chance at a bounty reward
- *Private bug-bounty program*: a limited access program that selected
  hackers are invited to participate in
- *Time-bound bug-bounty challenge*: limited access program with a
  pre-determined time frame














** Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP)

An organization's formalized method for receiving vulnerability
submissions from the outside world, sometimes referred to as
"Responsible Disclosure".

- *Scope*: what systems are covered by the VDP?
- *Eligibility*: what types of attacks/techniques are allowed?
- *Rewards*: what types of rewards are considered?
- *Out of scope*: what is explicitely disallowed
- *Fine print*: how to coordinate disclosure, consequences of
  compliance/non-compliance

Example: [[https://hackerone.com/dropbox][Dropbox]]

* Exercise


Work in groups. Find a vulnerability disclosure policy (VDP) from one of
the bug-bounty programmes.

* (There are no) True Safe Harbors


#+caption: image.png
[[file:img/finisterre.jpg]]

* Kevin Finisterre & DJI


- on august 28, 2017 DJI announced its bug bounty program
- no published guidelines, technical scope, or legal terms concerning
  the bug bounty

#+begin_quote
starting today [August 28, 2017], bug reports can be sent...for review
by technical experts,” that “rewards for qualifying bugs will range from
USD 100 to USD 30,000, depending on the potential impact of the threat
[...]

#+end_quote

- Finisterre found a critical vulnerability that leaked DJI customers
  identifiable information
- DJI communicated the scope of the bounty, Finisterre's vulnerability
  qualified for $30k!
- however, shortly after DJI allegedly threatened Finisterre with legal
  action, claiming that he accessed the servers without authorized
  access, and coered F. into a one-sided agreement that left him legally
  exposed
- Finisterre decided to withdraw from the bug bounty, but to publish his
  report and his experience

* Catch-22



#+begin_quote
the most rewarding vulnerabilities, the ones that require hackers to
provide "proof of concepts" showing how they gained "unauthorized
access," also require that hackers comply with "all laws," while not
explicitly granting them access or exempting them from liability

#+end_quote

#+caption: image.png
[[file:img/rewired.png]]

* Safe harbors?


- Although claiming to operate as safe harbors, *many programs include language that cannot be reconciled with the practice of security research*

- Most commonly, the legal language *requires that hackers comply with "all applicable laws,"* or forbids tests that "violate any law," instead of granting hackers clear authorization to construct a safe  harbor

- This practice shifts the *legal risk to the hacker*.

- There are some exceptions: a *minority of programs* specifically include *language that exempts hackers from liability*, noting in the contract that they will not take legal action against hackers who comply with the guidelines.

* Mixed signals


Under some programs terms hackers might be forced into contractual
breach and civil and criminal liability.

** Example

AVG terms stating that the submission of a bug "constitutes acceptance
of the AVG End User License Agreement." The AVG End User License
Agreement further stipulates that users "may not... (iii) except as
expressly authorized by law, 68 (A) reverse engineer, disassemble,
decompile, translate, reconstruct, transform or extract any [software]
or any portion of the [software]..., or (B) change, modify or otherwise
alter any [software]."

** Example 2

WhatsApp's terms state that the users “must not (or assist others to)
access, use, copy, adapt, modify, prepare...or otherwise exploit our
Services...directly or through automated means: (a) reverse engineer,
alter, modify, create derivative works from, decompile, or extract code
from our Services; (b) send, store, or transmit viruses or other harmful
computer code through or onto [their] Services; (c) gain or attempt to
gain unauthorized access to [their] Services or systems...

- framework to assist organizations interested in instituting a formal
  vulnerability disclosure program.
- no dictated form of or objectives for vulnerability disclosure
  programs;
- instead, it outlines a process for designing a vulnerability
  disclosure program that clearly describe authorized vulnerability
  disclosure and discovery conduct, to reduce likelyhood that activities
  result in criminal violations of CFAA (Computer Fraud and Abuse Act)

* Step 1: Design the vulnerability disclosure program


- Should the program include all the assets or just a subset?
  - this may be influenced by sensitivity of information, security
    safeguards already in place, organization's ability to segment the
    network, regulatory, contractual obligations
  - the organization should determine for the included assets: whether
    to restrict access to information, whether there should be special
    handling requirements for sensitive information, whether to impose
    restrictions to the techniques used
- Determine whether the program should differentiate among types of
  vulnerabilities, e.g.:
  - software bugs, poor password management, misconfigured systems,
    social engineering
- Consider whether any components require third-party interest and
  should be excluded from the program
  - e.g. if using a cloud provider, the data may coexist with other
    customers and should be exlcuded
- Review other resources for guidance on VDPs:
  - [[https://handbook.18f.gov/responding-to-public-disclosure-vulnerabilities/][18F vulnerability disclosure playbook]]
  - [[https://www.ntia.doc.gov/other-publication/2016/multistakeholder-process-cybersecurity-vulnerabilities][NTIA's multi-stakeholder work on vulnerabilities and disclosure]]
  - [[http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c045170_ISO_IEC_29147_2014.zip][ISO 29147, Vulnerability Disclosure]]
  - [[https://webstore.ansi.org/Standards/ISO/ISOIEC301112019][ISO 30111, Vulnerability handling processes]]

* Step 2: Plan for administering the VDP


- Determine how vulnerabilities are reported:
  - email account (e.g. security@org, avoid personal email)
  - public encryption key
  - how should proof of discovery be provided? type of data and quality
    of the report, what qualifies a valid submission, e.g. a screenshot?
  - suggested time frame for reporting: upon discovery, when feasible,
    once validated
- Assign a point-of-contact to receive vulnerability reports:
  - e.g. Computer Security Incident Response Service
- Identify personnel who can authoritatively answer questions about
  conduct that the organization's vulnerability disclosure program does
  and does not authorize.
- Decide how to handle accidental, good faith violations of the
  vulnerability disclosure policy, as well as intentional, malicious
  violations.

* Step 3: Draft a VDP that captures the organization's intent


- Describe authorized and unauthorized conduct in plain, easily
  understood terms
- Identify the network components or data in the policy that are within
  the scope of the program as specifically as possible.
- Describe how to identify information that is not within the scope of
  the program.
- Explain the restrictions the organization is imposing on that
  information.
- Explain the consequences of complying---and not complying---with the
  policy. E.g.:
  - The organization will not to pursue civil action for accidental,
    good faith violations of its policy or initiate a complaint to law
    enforcement for unintentional violations.
  - The organization considers activities conducted consistent with the
    policy to constitute "authorized" conduct under the Computer Fraud
    and Abuse Act.
  - If legal action is initiated by a third party against a party who
    complied with the vulnerability disclosure policy, the organization
    will take steps to make it known, either to the public or to the
    court, that the individual's actions were conducted in compliance
    with the policy.
- Encourage participants to contact the organization for clarification
  /before/ engaging in conduct that may be inconsistent with or
  unaddressed by the policy.

* Step 4: Implement the vulnerability disclosure program


- Make the vulnerability disclosure policy easily accessible and widely
  available.
  - Prominently display the policy on the organization's web site.
  - Advertise the vulnerability disclosure program in appropriate
    venues, such as mailing lists and press releases to trade
    publications.
- Encourage anyone who conducts vulnerability disclosure activities
  involving the organization's systems and data to do so under the
  organization's vulnerability disclosure program and consistent with
  its policies.
